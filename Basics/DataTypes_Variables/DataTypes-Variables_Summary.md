# Topic: Data types and Variables

---

## Concepts Practiced

1. variables: declaration and initialization

---

## Files in This Folder

- `VarDecInit.cpp`: showcase variable declaration and initialization
- `CharDecInit`: showcase character declaration and ASCII manipulations with char

---

## Key Learnings

1. a garbage value is stored if variable is not initialized with a value.

2. every character should be declared inside the single quotation

3. a character stores the ASCII value if the value initialized is numeric and not surrounded by single quotations

4. 2 digits are treated as double characters; throws warning and prints last digit. the result varies across compilers

## Next Steps
