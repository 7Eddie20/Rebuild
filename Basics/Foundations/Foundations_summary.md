# Topic: Foundations

## Concepts Practiced

1. endl and \n
2. The semicolon (;)
3. cin & cout
4. full line input with getline and delimiter

## Files in This Folder

- `add.cpp` – adds augend and the addend and display the sum
- `StringInput.cpp` – showcase the use of getline and delimiter
- …

## Bugs or Confusions Faced

- [ ] [Example: Assigned float to int → lost decimals]
- [ ] [Example: Used = instead of ==]

## Key Learnings

> endl and \n serves the same task, i.e. skipping to the next line
--
> The semicolon (;) is a statement terminator.
--
> cin is for taking the input from console while cout is for giving the output to the console.
--
> getline takes the whole input to the buffer unless specifies using a delimiter or a next line is consoled
