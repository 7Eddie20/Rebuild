## ✅ What I Learnt & Practiced This Week

> working of a CPU - how the cpu handles tasks, and the environment, ALU, CU, the IO devices and their buffers, the HDD storage and how main memory interacts with all of it.
> binary system and the saga of bits and bytes
> a computer is a computational device for solving complex computational tasks
> programming language is the medium between human and the machine to understand the data and instructions
> low level <> machine language < assembly language < high level language <> high level
> compiler and interpreter, basically compiler creates the .exe file after computing the source code while interpreter executes the source code line by line.
> JAVA hybrid model - source code <> (jdk) compiler <> byte code [machine independent] <> (jvm) interpreter <> machine code
> Operating System is the master software that manages the computer hardware and software resources while providing a platform for applications to run.
