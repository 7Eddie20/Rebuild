## ✅ What I Learnt/Practiced This Week

1. getline takes the whole input to the buffer unless specifies using a delimiter or a next line is consoled

2. `cin.ignore()` clears the leftover newline (`\n`) from the input buffer after `cin >>`, so `getline()` can read the next full line properly.

3. `istringstream` allows you to treat a string like an input stream, enabling word-by-word extraction using the `>>` operator. It's ideal for parsing space-separated data like names, commands, or tokens from a single string.
