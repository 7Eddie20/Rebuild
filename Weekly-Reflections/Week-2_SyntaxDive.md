# 🗓️ Weekly Reflection – Week 002

**Date Range:** Sun 24 AUG – Sat 30 AUG, 2025

**Theme/Title:** "Syntax dive"

## ✅ What I Learnt/Practiced This Week

1. getline takes the whole input to the buffer unless specifies using a delimiter or a next line is consoled

2. `cin.ignore()` clears the leftover newline (`\n`) from the input buffer after `cin >>`, so `getline()` can read the next full line properly.

3. `istringstream` allows you to treat a string like an input stream, enabling word-by-word extraction using the `>>` operator. It's ideal for parsing space-separated data like names, commands, or tokens from a single string.

4. Instructions are stored in the code segment. Local variables go to the stack. Dynamically allocated data is stored in the heap. Global and static variables reside in the data segment. All of these are part of the main memory.

5. To store more than what th ceiling of a byte permits, we need to add the bytes as required.

6. The variables are given the required memory by the CPU, the larger a data is, the more memory it will be provided.

7. Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in programming, representing simple values like integers, characters, booleans, and floating-point numbers.

8. Type modifiers like `short`, `long`, `signed`, and `unsigned` are used to adjust the size and range of primitive data types—`short` and `long` change how much memory a variable uses, while `signed` and `unsigned` control whether it can store negative values or only positives.

9. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding system that represents text in computers using numeric codes—each character (like letters, digits, and symbols) is assigned a value from 0 to 127, making it easy for machines to store and process human-readable text.

10. variables are containers with data type, name, value and assigned memory location used to store data.

11. every character should be declared inside the single quotation. A character stores the ASCII value if the value initialized is numeric and not surrounded by single quotations.

12. `sizeof()` gives the amount of bytes a variable will use in the memory.

13. setprecision(n) – Control Decimal Precision

14. A boolean is a data type that holds only two possible values: true or false. It's used to control logic flow, especially in conditions and decision-making statements like if, while, or for.

15. - A bool:
            false is represented by 0
            true is represented by any non-zero value, but usually 1

16. Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another to ensure compatibility or precision control in computations.
